# Groovy Vampires

The pdf is included here. The source code is in two locations. The first
is the Groovy source that accesses data at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com
and populates the MongoDB database, along with simple query scripts for the
results. That's part of the [Making Java Groovy](http://manning.com/kousen)
source code, in the ch08/VampireMovies subdirectory.

The book repo is at https://github.com/kousen/Making-Java-Groovy .

The other source repo is the Grails application that serves data from the
Mongo DB as a RESTful service. Find that at
[GrailsVampires](https:/github.com/kousen/GrailsVampires) .

To use them, you need to:
- Run a local MongoDB instance on port 27017
- Add a file called 'rotten_tomatoes_apiKey.txt' with the key you get from
registering at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com

# Gradle for Android

Here is the [source code repo](http://github.com/kousen/Gr8Demo). The app was
written using Android Studio version 0.8.4.

# Spock Friendly Testing

The slides are included. The source code comes from the
[Making Java Groovy](http://manning.com/kousen) source code
[repo](https://github.com/kousen/Making-Java-Groovy) in ch06/Spock-Examples.
