My talks don't have a real presentation, but consists of live
coding a bunch of code snippets. 

Some of the code snippets shown on stage can be found
in the following Github repositories. 

Also try
the +sandbox+ directory which contains the code I have
written preparing the talks. The +sandbox+ has more code
than I had time to show in the talks, so you can find
more snippets there.
